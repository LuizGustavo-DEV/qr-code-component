## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Every Layout components
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

I've put in practice my current understanding of the CUBE CSS methodology to develop this solution.
My main goal is to grasp the concept further and to start writting more concise and more reusable CSS.

### Continued development

I've learned about CUBE CSS and Every Layout recently, and while my knowledge on both is limited
I aim to study the subject and put what I learn in practice in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) - My source for some of the components that I have used, mainly the cover and stack components, and the one I wish to study further.
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) - The methodology applied with the best of my ability that I wish to study further as well.
